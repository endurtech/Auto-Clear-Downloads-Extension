# Auto Clear Downloads
A browser extension for the Brave browser to clear all completed downloads after two minutes. This extensions fixes the original Always Clear Downloads that can no longer be installed since Google discontinued support for extensions using [manifest.json version 1](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifestVersion)

version 1.0 - This version modernizes the code to use the most recent Chrome APIs. Should also prevent the extension from going inactive. This version requires more permissions so you will have to re-enable the extension. The new permission simply allows the extension to access the download shelf.

#### Original extension description

This Google Chrome extension makes up for the fact that Chrome does not have an option to keep its download list clear at all times. You can clear the downloads list yourself by hand, but Chrome currently doesn't have an option to automatically clear it for you. This extension does it for you automatically.

This extension works in a very simple way: Every five seconds, the downloads list is cleared out for you. Don't worry, the files you downloaded are still there, and in-progress downloads are not harmed. Chrome's internal list simply gets cleaned up for you every five seconds.
