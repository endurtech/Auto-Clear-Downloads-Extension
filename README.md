# Auto Clear Downloads
A Brave browser extension to clear all completed downloads & hide the downloads icon in toolbar after two minutes. This extension was cloned from the Always Clear Downloads 2 Extension [Always Clear Downloads 2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/always-clear-downloads-2/jcajchndfkmnaefkhoaoiagemplbfffn) which would do the same after 5 seconds. Like my 2 minute version? [Buy me a cup of coffee](https://endurtech.com/give-thanks/).
